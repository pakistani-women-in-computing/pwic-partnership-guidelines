# PWiC Advertising Policies

Pakistani Women in Computing (PWiC) publishes items throughout the year including but not limited to the Facebook posts, LinkedIn posts, blogs, and/or twitter publicizing their many events. This policy clarifies how businesses can be listed in our publications. PWiC does not sell advertising but we can solicit sponsorships.

## PWiC does not sell Advertising.
Our organization does not sell or print advertising in any of our publications.

## Why do we not sell Advertising?
The PWiC is a nonprofit 501c(3) corporation registered in WA state. As a nonprofit we need to conduct business that is substantially in line with our tax- exempt purpose or we may be responsible for paying Unrelated Business Income Tax. Having to pay Unrelated Business Income Tax would likely complicate our tax return making it cost more for preparation and provide little financial benefit for the limited funds we would likely earn from any Unrelated Business Income.

As of the policy effective date the IRS considers "advertising" Unrelated Business Income, they do allow a nonprofit to conduct up to $1,000 per year of Unrelated Business Income without paying the tax but as a general rule the PWiC will still avoid the sale of advertising in any amount.

## Sponsorships
While the IRS considers "advertising" Unrelated Business Income, sponsorships are considered excluded income and therefore are allowed. PWiC can solicit sponsorships and acknowledge these sponsors in our publications.

## What Qualifies as a Sponsorship?
Sponsorship involves a donation to our organization from a business or corporation. The donations can be cash or in-kind (including material or services). We will acknowledge and thank sponsors for their donation by placing only their name, contact information and/or logo in our publications, no additional information such as coupons, business reviews, endorsements or additional information that could be construed as advertising may be used in our publications. Sponsors should be made aware that their donations will be to PWiC. While a sponsor may choose to fund a specific need or a specific program any excess funds collected will be used for the PWiCâ€™s general fund.
